 					<p>I work for a new company now and its awesome. Wheels Up is about to hit their five year anniversary which, coincidentally, is on my birthday. We just had our first celebration for the digital team, as a release went out on 7/19. We put out social features for members of our app to be able to communicate with one another when attempting to split fares with shared flights</p>
 					<p>This place rocks.</p>

 					<p>I just got back from Europe. Holy shit. That was awesome. I spent 2 weeks there with my friends from college, Pete and Michael. We spent 3-4 days in each location. From Paris to Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague. I rode a hangover from my arrival in Paris to my retun home to JFK at the end of the trip. </p>
 					<p>Pictures soon to come.</p>

 				<p> Long story short... I'm scrapping this design. I like the hobbies page, its cool and all. But that's it. Enough Gifs. Enough useless content. This site is supposed to showcase who I am and the gifs are just a representation of my likes, not my character. Big picture was not the intent of this site initially. See me in 3 months when the site is fully redesigned</p>
 				<p>Countless hours have been spent in my life learning new things. Things that no one taught me to do until I "had" to learn how to do it because I was told that was the case. Things management doesn't teach you. Things no one teaches you but your own experiences. Things you learn in the real world. How to read API JSONs when you never knew what a JSON was before. Learning what is and how to use Charles Proxy, so as to determine network calls for media players, commerce flows, or geolocation and content blocking. <strong>Being able to communicate the point effectively to meet the expectations of your clients and peers</strong>. Learning a new coding language independently prevent your own obsolescence. Knowing what is IN AND OUT OF SCOPE in terms of your job, the project, the expectations, and literally anything else that is defined by some sort of requirement. Knowing your own capabilities and being able to deliver something that gives you self-worth. The time you spend with the people that drive you to be better than you were before. None of these things are taught. All things are learned through experience. I am firmly a kinesthetic learner and an advocate for immersion with those who aim to achive something bigger than the individual. </p>
 				<p>This site will continue to exist as an expression of my thoughts and feelings during the past year - maybe some pages will carry on outside of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Archive.gov webcrawler</a> - and in the future you will see a new form that represents my ideals, values, and both personal and professional aspirations. I gave it my best, given a full-time job, a three hour commute, and a lack of both physical and mental strength. This was an experiment, first and foremost. I had no goals when I bought this domain. That said, goal line has shifted and, as a result, so have my intentions. Take care, now. Bye bye, then. End goal: less CSS, more "content". To those of you who say: "James, there's nothing here. What gives?" I say: "How did you even know I had a site? You fricken creep."

 					<p>Spent wayyyy too much time on PUBG this weekend to do more work on here just yet. It seems to only be possible to work on this in an instance like today where the work queue is dead. Riot testing has gone smoothly since our last client demo. Its crickets today though, guess it will be more core player work.</p>
 					<p>I've been thinking more about the "hobbies" page and how its getting oversaturated with gif content. I'm wondering if there's a way I can make the rotating cubes into a smaller panel of these that fluctuates on a timer. Say every 10s the cube eases into a new image or something. I'll base it so it updates off each rotation. However, I'd like to have more than one visible at a time and making these items float properly as inline elements has proved tricky. </p>
 					<p>The design of this page sucks too but this is just a template. The time will come where I mock this stuff up and get a reasonable outline</p>

 					<p>Gotta update the content on this site. There's no consistent styling so most of today i'll be working out some drawn out designs and try to build a complete mockup which I can use to thematically code this site a little better. Right now its like I'm throwing extra content here and there but not making the site "look" any better. I thought it would be easier to create a style once I knew what content to put on here, but this is a pet project so there's no expectations. I'll keep adding to this blog each day that I can work on the site until its ready to actually show to people.</p>
 					<p>Work today is going to be Riot testing all day, which is awesome cause LOL has some interesting content and I'm obviously into gaming. Never played League of Legends but might one day. Personally I've been on a Zelda BOTW/Gears 4/PUBG bender. Shout out to my brother <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mcsloppy">McSloppy</a>, who Twitch streams his PUBG matches.</p>
 					<p>I also need to make more of an effort to train myself on new things. Part of the reason I build the "experiments" page was for this purpose: to try out things I never have before. The first experiment being my Kingdom Hearts cubes. I wanted to start with something that had a cool feel and relied primarily on CSS, though I want to move onto more complicated things like jQuery/Javascript. Already have knowledge on it and was able to make the slideshow on the homepage but I'd like to try something a little more user friendly.</p>
